# Anita - Cycle tracker

Anita is a website that helps women for monitoring their menstrual cycle and helping to predict periods. It also allows users to record additional information, such as symptoms that occured in a selected day and period flow.

After sign up, the user is redirected to the "About you" page, where they insert useful information that will be used to predict future periods. 

This project was designed for project2 for the Immersive Software Engineer course from General Assembly, where a full stack development app techiniques were intended to be developed.

This repository contains the backend code project. React repository is [here](https://github.com/Gissell10/period-traker).

Project designed by [Isabel](https://github.com/isabelsousac), [Gissell](https://github.com/Gissell10) and [Kylie](https://github.com/kyliexmq).

## Website

This repository application can be accessed through [here](https://cycle-tracker-backend.herokuapp.com/)

## Stack
 * Ruby
 * Ruby on Rails
 * JWT API
 * PostgreSQL

 ## API endpoints
 [Here](API.md). Some of them are still to be implemented.


## Future improvements
* Make a better prediction of the periods after the user logs 3 of them.
* More API endpoints are still to be implemented, such as access to single period information and list of all symptoms logged during one entire cycle.
* Create a graphic about the main symptoms women tend to have during specifics days of cycle - all women will have access to it, but no identity will be reveled.
