# Cycle tracker

Cycle tracker is a website that helps women for monitoring their menstrual cycle and helping to predict periods. It also allow users to record additional information, such as symptoms that occured in a selected day and period flow.

After sign up, the user is redirected to the "About you" page, where they insert useful information that will be used to predict future periods. 

This project was designed for project2 for the Immersive Software Engineer course from General Assembly, where a full stack development app techiniques were intended to be developed.

This repository contains the backend code project. React repository is [here](https://github.com/Gissell10/period-traker).

Project designed by [Isabel](https://github.com/isabelsousac), [Gissell](https://github.com/Gissell10) and Kylie.

## Future improvements
This website is still giving their first steps. I plan to use other API's to grab more information and images from the artists. Users should have followers, so then they can find others songs through each other. I'm also open to suggestions.
